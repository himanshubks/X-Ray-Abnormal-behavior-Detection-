#Key Objectives of Our System:

• Create a model designed to accurately detect and highlight abnormalities in X-ray images.
• Train the model effectively using a dataset of over 50,000 training images, mitigating over-fitting and under-fitting challenges.
• Optimize the abnormality detection process to deliver significantly faster results compared to manual detection.
• Develop a model that achieves a high level of accuracy in detecting abnormalities, ensuring reliable and precise results.

By achieving these objectives, our project aims to contribute to the early and efficient detection of musculoskeletal abnormalities through advanced machine learning techniques, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
